Notes:
- Castling can only be triggered by the King, can't be triggered by the rooks as they can normally move to their post castling position without issue

Stockfish UCI
Python UCI library

We need to keep board state


Procedure for engine access

- Initialise engine synchronously (Downsides? may take a while, who cares?)
	-Pop engine
	-Send uci command
- Set board fen
- Set engine position


Overall scheme:
- Player makes move, AI then moves.

Bigger breakdown:
- Main thread is simply interacting with the human user, it is simply waiting for human input and then it forwards that on.
	- Main thread also needs to be able to receive input from another thread about what to display!
- Move is submitted,
	- Need to check that this move is coming from the expected person (AI or Human)
- If a human move, then need to do relevant updated to our relevant board
	- If an AI move, then need to do updates to their board.
- Mechanism to receive moves from Human player is already done? Is it ? Not really done well. 
- Need a mechanism to receive updates from the AI.
	- Have a queue like mechanism for all moves received
