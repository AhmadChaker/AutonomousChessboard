Chess notes:
- Castling can only be triggered by the King, can't be triggered by the rooks as they can normally move to their post castling position without issue

Python notes:
- Python has a global interpretter lock (GIL) so multithreading is not really multithreading, we use multiprocess

Engine notes:
- Stockfish UCI
- Python UCI library
- For utilising stockfish we must keep the board state ourselves 
How do I access the engine?
- Initialise engine synchronously, no real drawback as it's running in its own process so won't block.
- To run stockfish we run popengine() followed by uci()


Code flow:
- Main thread is simply interacting with the human user, it is simply waiting for human input and then it forwards that on.
	- Main thread also needs to be able to receive input from another thread about what to display, it should accept messages.
- Move is submitted.
	- Need to check that this move is coming from the expected person (AI or Human)
- If a human moves, then need to do relevant updates to our board state and then put the resultant board state on the relevant AI or human queue
- Mechanism to receive moves from Human player is provided for free by the python GUI infrastructure.  
- AI move generation needs to hook into the Game queue to send desired moves to the "central game authority", The "central game authority" needs to also request moves from the AI.
