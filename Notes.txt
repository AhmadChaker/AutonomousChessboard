Notes:
- Castling can only be triggered by the King, can't be triggered by the rooks as they can normally move to their post castling position without issue

Enhancements:
1) Starting off at a certain configuration on the chess board

Detecting pieces - Mesh?

Rooks need validation of their starting position ! in case we want to start at a specific configuration
Don't want castling in "middle" of a configured game.
